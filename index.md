## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, part 1

  This was one of my favorite labs because it was my very first lab I've ever done in my life. I was introduced to coding for the first time which was a realy fun experience. I was very excited to continue coding after I completed my first lab. 

* Lab 4, part 1

  THis was another of my favorite lab I did because it was my first lab that I had trouble with. Me and my partner really had to think hard when completing this lab. But despite the trouble we had, it was still very fun dealing with inputs and outputs.

* Lab 10, part 1

  This was another of my favorite labs I did this semester because it was one of the labs I had the most fun with. Having to work with prime numbers in coding was so much fun. After completing the lab, I remembered I gained so much more experience about coding and dealing with prime numbers.
